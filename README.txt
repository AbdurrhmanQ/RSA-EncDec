First, run the program, and the program will check if you have a file named "text.txt", if there's no such file the program will create one and terminate.
After the first run, enter your requird text preceding your e and n and make sure you leave space between (e) and (n).
Then run the program again and the menu will show you three options, 1- is for encryption, 2- is for decryption(but you will need to have a file named "text.rsa"), and 3- to terminate the program.
Running the program and starting with option 1, will start encryption, then will create a file("text.rsa") and write the encrypted message in it, and then take you back to main menu.
Option 2 will start decryption then write it to "text.dec" file and then terminate immediatly without going back to the main menu.
